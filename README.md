Vacation project 2024 : Mastermind

This project includes a working[?] version of the code guessing game Mastermind. 
Additionally, the game works with profile system to record player highscores.
The profile data is stored in a JSON file.

Rules:

    The aim of the game is to guess the hidden code.

    The code will be created from a set of six different colors. 
    The code will never include duplicate colors.

    The player have ten [10] guesses to match the code. 

    When guessing, the player must follow the following rules:
        [A] The guess must not inculde duplicates
        [B] The guess must be four characters long
        [C] The guess must be made up of the numbers depicted at the top of the game board.

    If the player wishes to return to the menu during a game, they can press 'X'.

Menu Options:

    The game menu includes the following options:
    
        1. Set Active Profile - This allows for the recording of game highscores. Without an active profile, the game will be run as a guest. No score will be recorded. 
        2. Start Game - Initiates the game... duh.
        3. Show High Scores - Shows the top five [5] high scores... again, pretty self explanitory.
        4. Create New Profile - You can use this option to create a new profile.
        5. Delete Profile - You can use this option to order Taco Bell. -_-
        6. Exit Game - You will never believe what this one does.

Anyways... this project is not meant to be perfect. Frankly, there are a number of things that I notice that I could change. Function summaries probably. Regardless, I have spent like two [2] years learning Python for school and I wanted to make something for it. Also, Im working on another project and I needed to practice.
